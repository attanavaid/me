This website was made to showcase all of the\n            work that I have published in the professional workspace.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I got into development because I believe being able to program code\n            is an ability people will need to survive in the future. The fact\n            that almost everything in this world can be programmed to do\n            anything you want is fascinating to me. My desire to become a\n            developer came from playing games during my childhood and\n            interacting with unique websites everyday.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I got into 3D modelling, texturing, and designing, because of my\n            aspiration to learn game development and hopefully create my own\n            game or be involved in a team that aims to create a great game.\n            Since I played a lot of games that brought me joy, I wanted others\n            to feel the same way the developers of those games made me feel.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I got into designing because I like to make sure my designs, are\n            exactly the way I want them. Plus, being able to make digital artist\n            is a big win in the current online world. So, I tried taught myself\n            about art and design using the biggest program at the time, which\n            was Adobe.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I created this portfolio so I could showcase all that I have to\n            offer and make it simpler for you to understand my capabilities and\n            connect with me easily.

I would love to hear from you!\n          </p>\n\n          <CTA className=\"items-start\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"names":["className","href","Resume","download","size","id","src","ME","alt","loading","resumePrview"],"ignoreList":[],"sourceRoot":""}
